A mobile fitness and health tracking application built with Flutter. This app allows users to create an account, log in, and monitor their daily activity, including steps, calories burned, and water intake. All user and health data is stored locally on the device using an `sqflite` database.

This project is currently in development as part of a university assignment, focusing on local database management and feature-based architecture.
